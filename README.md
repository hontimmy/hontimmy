### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a full-stack developer with **7 years of hands-on experience** crafting scalable, efficient, and robust applications using:

- **Laravel & Symfony (PHP)** – for elegant back-end APIs and complex business logic  
- **Go (Golang)** – for high-performance services and concurrency-heavy tools  
- **Node.js** – for event-driven, fast back-end systems

I thrive in building solutions that are not only functional but also clean and maintainable. I’ve contributed to open-source projects, built SaaS platforms, and led engineering efforts from concept to deployment.
